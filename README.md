# TileMapEditor

_Project is work in progress_

-   What is it ?

I'm learning how to use ReactJs, and to do so I'm making a tile base map editor (like Tiled www.mapeditor.org) using reactjs and electronjs to make it a desktop app.

# Launch

To start on `localhost:3000` use :

```
npm start
```

To start the electron app during dev (requier the node server to be up on the port 3000) use :

```
npm run electron-dev
```
